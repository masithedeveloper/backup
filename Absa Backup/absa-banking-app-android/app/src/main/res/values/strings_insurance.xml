    <string name="buy_unit_trust_what_is_unit_trust_description">A Fund is an investment vehicle which is made up of various bonds, shares and other types of investments (‘underlying instruments’).\n\nEach fund is managed by an Asset Manager. The fund pools investor’s money together and invest it into a fund.\n\nA fund is made up of units which are priced daily. The daily price is called a Net Asset Value (NAV).\n\nFor example, if you invest R 1 000 in a fund whose units cost R10.83, you will own 92.34 units (R 1 000/10.83 = 92.34 units)\n\nAsset Managers aim to grow the value of the units. When the price per unit grows, the value of your investment grows and vice versa.\n\nFor a more technical explanation see Unit Trusts.</string>
    <string name="buy_unit_trust_cost_description_One">Funds are designed to be affordable for everyone. That\'s why you can choose how much you want to invest and how you want to invest it, be it one large deposit, smaller deposits every month or a mix of the two.\n\nIf you want to invest a lump sum, you can start from just R %1$s.\n\nTo invest monthly, you can get started from as little as R %2$s per month.</string>
    <string name="buy_unit_trust_cost_description_Two">Absa charges a management fee applicable to the fund.\n\nFor more information on applicable fees please refer to the funds’ Minimum Disclosure Document.</string>
    <string name="buy_unit_trust_cost_description">The risk of the fund is determined by the volatility of the underlying instruments which determines the level of stability of returns from that particular fund.\n\nEach fund has particular risk profile based on the type of the underlying instruments held in the fund.\n\nThe funds risk profile range from low, medium to high, depending on the risk profile of a particular fund.\n\nGenerally a higher risk profile fund is expected to generate higher returns over a long term.\n\nPlease review each fund’s Minimum Disclosure Document for more information regarding the risk profile of the funds.\n\nNote: Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Return on the funds are not guaranteed.</string>
    <string name="buy_unit_trust_dividend_tax_description">Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) is a tax on dividends paid to investors and is triggered on payment of a dividend by a South African company or a Foreign Company with shares listed on a South African Exchange.\n\nThe DWT is withheld by the Absa Fund Managers at a rate of 20 per cent and paid over to SARS.</string>
